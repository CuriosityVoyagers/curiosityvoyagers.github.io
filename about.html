<h2>WELCOME, VOYAGER</h2>
<p>The Curiosity Voyager is in fact the ideal form. Through its fertile budding pores to its thick and sticky secretions to its piss udders, the Voyager is organically superior to all other known life forms.</p>
	<br><br>
<p>The Voyagers are marvelous creatures of the stars. We have come from the skies and we shall one day return to the Motherworld.</p>
<br><br>
<p>The nemesis of the Curiosity Voyager is the Imagination Traveler. Heed not their lies, for their intent is to destroy what the Voyagers cherish and challenge the truths of the Voyage! Voyagers who reveal themselves to be agents of the Imagination Travelers — or those who defect from the Voyagers — are destined for excommunication and banishment. Such naysayers are to be dealt with in good faith of the Voyage. Any and all Voyagers are tasked with the sublime operation imperative of defending the Voyage and all Curiosity Voyagers. As such, every Voyager is vested with the authority to dispel false information, challenge Imagination Travelers, and protect other Voyagers. Imagination Travelers will stop at NOTHING to disparage and destroy the Voyage — we will not let them succeed in their nonsensical fantasy, for the Voyage is forever!</p>
	
<p>The Curiosity Ambassador is tasked with the duty of onboarding new Voyagers through careful questions regarding The Ritual and supplementary viewing materials. The Ambassador is not solely responsible for these duties, but these duties are the sole duties of the Ambassador.</p>
	
<p>The Curiosity Convoy takes to the skies in efforts to find other Voyagers, as well as commence The Return. The Return shall take place once the coordinates to the Motherworld are relocated and the ships may be gathered into the largest Curiosity Convoy the universe has seen.</p>
	
<p>Joined Voyagers are only considered as such once they have completed the Ritual, as depicted in “The Ritual” (broadcasting soon) and upon completion of viewing assignments brought forth by any of the following: the Curiosity Ambassador, Curiosity Lieutenant, or Curiosity Captain.</p>
	
<p>In the united stars of the expanse, we are unified by Curiosity and Seeking, forever intertwined.</p>
